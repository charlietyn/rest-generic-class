# Introduction

**Rest Generic Class** is a Laravel package that supplies base model, service, and controller classes for building RESTful endpoints with minimal boilerplate. It focuses on:

- Query-driven filtering with a structured `oper` syntax.
- Safe relation loading using allowlisted relations.
- Field selection and pagination (including cursor pagination).
- Optional hierarchical listing for self-referencing models.
- Optional permission utilities for Spatie Laravel Permission.

If you are new to the package, start with the [Quickstart](../01-getting-started/02-quickstart.md).
