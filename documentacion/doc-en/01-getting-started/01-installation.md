# Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require ronu/rest-generic-class
```

Laravel package auto-discovery registers the service provider automatically.

## Publish configuration (optional)

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=rest-generic-class-config
```

This publishes `config/rest-generic-class.php` into your application.
